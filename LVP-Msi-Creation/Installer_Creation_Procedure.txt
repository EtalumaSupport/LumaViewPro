Unzip the folder. In the LVP folder, paste the apache-maven-3.9.8 folder. (Should be in the same way a package folder is in the LVP folder)
Create a blank file named "marker.lvpinstalled" in the same directory.

1) Make sure that you have Visual Studio 2022 downloaded and installed along with the .NET framework and Visual C++
