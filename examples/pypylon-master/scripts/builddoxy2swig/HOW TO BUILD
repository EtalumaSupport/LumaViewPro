The script builddoxygen.py generates DoxyGenApi.i and DoxyPylon.i from your Pylon installation.

To rebuild the swigfiles from your Pylon installation
you need the following programs:

- Python (we used 3.5)
- Some version of Pylon (pylon 5.0.7 Build 9644 was used).
- Doxygen 1.5.9 (newest version at the time(1.8.3) does not parse XML correctly)
